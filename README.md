👋 Hi, I’m Mustafa Raza — welcome to my GitHub!

I'm passionate about using **data** to drive decisions, solve problems, and tell clear, impactful stories. With a background in IT and a strong interest in data analysis, I’m building hands-on experience across tools like **Power BI**, **SQL**, **Excel**, and **Python**.

Here on GitHub, you’ll find:

📊 Dashboards and visual reports created with **Power BI**  
📁 Real-world projects involving **data cleaning**, **analysis**, and **insights**  
🔎 SQL queries and automation scripts for data workflows  
📚 What I’ve learned along the way — from courses, internships, and personal experiments

I enjoy turning raw numbers into insights and creating visuals that make data easy to understand for everyone.

Thanks for stopping by — whether you’re exploring, learning, or collaborating!

**Let’s grow, share, and build — one dataset at a time.**
